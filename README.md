# Advent of Code 2022

An interface for Advent of Code 2022 solutions. The `./public/inputs` folder contains my personalized inputs that can be edited in runtime to easily test the solutions (in TypeScript) that are also loaded dynamically.

## Solutions

Solutions are found in `./src/solutions` folder; each day has its own folder named `day-n` where n is an integer from 1 to 25, and inside the day folder there are files `1.ts` and `2.ts` for parts 1 and 2 of the daily exercise respectively. Each day folder is a module.

To run the app with your own solutions, replace the `solutions` folder with your own, following the naming convention mentioned above.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
